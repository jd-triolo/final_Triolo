					<h3>Decades in the Making</h3>
					<p>Gun Control is one of the most prevalent issues in the United States today and is in the headline of almost every news story. Firearm deaths have consistently increased in the last 40 or so years, and it is time for a change. The United States is developing a jarring numbness to the increasing epidemic of shootings, suicide, and overall death by firearm, and we need to call those in power into action and force a change. </p>
					<p>In America, guns have become increasingly normal, and according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="blank_">a recent article</a> published on Pew Research, a nonpartisan “think tank” that provides information on many different social issues today, four-in-ten U.S. adults live in a household with a gun. This is a sharp image of just how prevalent guns have become in this country, and the adaptability America has had to face when it comes to firearms as a whole.</p>
					<p>This firearm crisis has been decades in the making, as we see with the steady increase of firearm death from 1981. Gun control conversations are incredibly controversial, simply because under the United States Constitution, specifically the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms is protected. However, no other country sees more mass shootings or higher suicide rates by firearm. There are two sides to every story, but the data attached shows the steady increase of firearm deaths and emphasizes the necessity for change simply with facts and numbers.</p>
					<p>The data referenced throughout this webpage was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. I reached out to the CDC and the publisher of the data, USAFacts, for a comment on the methodology on how the data was collected and why the dataset starts in 1981, but they refused to comment. I reached out to multiple Firearm Prevention Organizations and multiple Suicide Prevention Organizations and none responded for comment.</p>

America consistently refuses to do anything about this problem, and we as citizens need to push for change. A 37.5% increase in firearm deaths in one decade shows the sheer severity of the problem and the ongoing epidemic this issue has become. There really are no two sides anymore, it's saving lives or not saving lives.

        				<strong>According to the dataset referenced throughout this webpage from the CDC, Suicide is the leading cause of death by firearm. </strong> When impressionable youth are surrounded by guns in the home, one little depressive episode could result in life-long consequences. With the accessibility guns have today, Americans as a whole become more numb to the idea of holding and shooting a gun. Depression, anxiety, and overall mental health issues are huge problems in the United States and having access to a gun could quickly escalate these situations.

Firearms have a certain masculinity about them, therefore more men are willing to carry and have a firearm in their household. More men die by a firearm each year than females and the number has increased steadily since 1981. Close to six times the amount of males have died compared to females by a firearm since 1981.

					<h3>Suicide by Firearm</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>Suicide is the leading cause of death by firearm in the United States. This trend has consistently been rising since 1981, and the numbers have only increased. The highest rate firearm suicide rate occurred in 2018, and I believe the numbers are set to increase, considering the increasing pattern seen in the chart below and the data directly from the CDC</p>
					<p>In an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/more-20-000-people-die-gun-suicide-each-year-alarmed-n906796" target="blank_">article published</a> in 2018 by NBC News, a story is told of a man in his 40s committing suicide at Rowdy’s Range & Shooter Supply in St. George, Utah, while standing in the practice lane after renting a gun for simple target practice. The company’s owner, Rowdy Reeve, and two other co-owners of the company joined a conversation and growing movement that spreads preventional techniques for suicide among sellers, owners, renters, and users.</p>
					<p>This collaboration seems odd at first due to America’s sharp polarization between political sides and especially regarding the conversation of gun ownership and gun rights overall. In the article, Catherine Barber, director of the Means Matter Campaign which prevents suicide at the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center said, “This is a new way to go about reducing suicidal persons’ access to guns — not by promoting an anti-gun agenda but by asking gun owners to be part of the solution.”</p>

					<h3>What Now?</h3>
					<p>After talking with Syracuse's Department of Security Office, a Sargeant said, "more cops armed in the streets, the safer we are." When asked if they do mental health checks on their officers throughout their time on the force, the Sargeant refused to comment but did mention that DPS does a mental health test before hiring an officer. Continuous mental health checks on officers and anyone licensed to carry a gun should be the standard in any police force.</p>
					<p>By allowing people who are pro-gun to join the fight against unsafe firearm deaths, we can effectively combine political sides and work to end suicide deaths by firearm. It is not just firearm laws that are important, it is firearm safety as a whole. With so much accessibility to guns, safety should be first and foremost. If one believes guns in the household are necessary, make sure they are locked away and far from children or teenagers. Keeping track of mental health issues with not only children and teenagers but also adults.</p>
